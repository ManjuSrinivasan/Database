Database options:

         Regardless of whether you go with a SQL or NoSQL database (or both!), there are plenty of options to choose from.

On-premise SQL database offerings include:

       ** MySQL – as mentioned prior, the most popular open-source relational database
       ** Microsoft SQL server – Microsoft’s enterprise version of SQL
       ** PostgreSQL – and enterprise-level, open-source database focused on extensibility
       ** Oracle – full-service (and expensive) SQL option
       ** MariaDB – an enhanced version of MySQL, built by MySQL’s original developers

The major cloud service platforms have their own SQL options:

        ** AWS has:

               >> RDS, their standard cloud SQL database
               >> Aurora, which focuses on increased throughput and scalability

        ** Microsoft Azure has:

               >> Azure SQL Database, their managed database-as-a-service
               >> Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB

        ** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has:
        
               >> Cloud SQL, which you can use for MySQL and PostgreSQL
               >> Cloud Spanner, which combines elements of SQL and NoSQL


On-premise NoSQL database options include:

         ->> MongoDB – by far the most popular NoSQL database
         ->> Redis – an open source, distributed, in-memory key-value database that is super fast
         ->> Cassandra – free, open-source NoSQL database created by Facebook that focuses on scalability and high availability


Cloud service providers offer plenty of NoSQL options as well:

        ** AWS has:

              >> DynamoDB, its managed NoSQL database
              >> DocumentDB, a fast, scalable, highly-available MongoDB-compatible database
