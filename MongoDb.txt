What is Document databases?
    --> Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.
    --> Each document contains pairs of fields and values.
    --> The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects,
                and their structures typically align with objects developers are working with in code. 
    --> Because of their variety of field value types and powerful query languages, 
                document databases are great for a wide variety of use cases and can be used as a general purpose database. 
    --> They can horizontally scale-out to accomodate large data volumes. 
    --> MongoDB is consistently ranked as the world’s most popular NoSQL database according to DB-engines and is an example of a document database. 

MongoDB :

The following are some of the benefits and strengths of MongoDB:

   ** Free to use: Since October 2018, MongoDB's updates have been published under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) v1, 
                   and the database is free to use.

   ** Dynamic schema: As mentioned, this gives you the flexibility to change your data schema without modifying any of your existing data.

   ** Scalability: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, which helps reduce the workload and scale your business with ease.

   ** Manageability: The database doesn’t require a database administrator. 
                     Since it is fairly user-friendly in this way, it can be used by both developers and administrators.

   ** Speed: It’s high-performing for simple queries.

   ** Flexibility: You can add new columns or fields on MongoDB without affecting existing rows or application performance.

   ** Not Acid Compliant: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB is not ACID compliant. See PostgreSQL above for more about ACID compliance.

   ** MongoDB Atlas (a new feature): MongoDB recently added MongoDB Atlas global cloud database technology to its offerings. 
                                     This feature allows you to deploy fully-managed MongoDB via AWS, Azure, or GCP. 
                                     MongoDB Atlas lets you use drivers, integrations, and tools to reduce the time required to manage your database.
                                     Here's the pricing information from Atlas.

                                     
Who Should Use It? 
 
     --> MongoDB is a good choice for businesses that have rapid growth or databases with no clear schema definitions
                     (i.e., you have a lot of unstructured data).
     --> If you cannot define a schema for your database, if you find yourself denormalizing data schemas, or 
                if your data requirements and schemas are constantly evolving - as is often the case with 
                        mobile apps, real-time analytics, content management systems, etc.
