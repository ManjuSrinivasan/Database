What is Database?

   => A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
   => A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). 
   => Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,often shortened to just database.

What is DBMS (Data Base Management System)?

   => Database management System is software which is used to store and retrieve the database.
   => DBMS provides the interface to perform the various operations like creation, deletion, modification, etc.
   => DBMS allows the user to create their databases as per their requirement.
   => DBMS accepts the request from the application and provides specific data through the operating system.
   => DBMS contains the group of programs which acts according to the user instruction.
   => It provides security to the database.
   => For example, Oracle, MySQL, etc..these are some popular DBMS tools.

What is the Purpose?

    -> The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.
    -> There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. 
         >> For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.
    -> There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
    -> Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).

What is SQL?

     ==> SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. 
     ==> SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.


What is RDBMS ?

      ** RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems..
      ** All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.
      ** It is called Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.

How it works?

     << Data is represented in terms of tuples (rows) in RDBMS.
     << Relational database is most commonly used database. 
     << It contains number of tables and each table has its own primary key.
     << Due to a collection of organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.

Types of databases available in the market :-

      ** Centralised database.
      ** Distributed database.
      ** Personal database.
      ** End-user database.
      ** Commercial database.
      ** NoSQL database.
      ** Operational database.
      ** Relational database.
      ** Cloud database.
      ** Object-oriented database.
      ** Graph database.

      

Difference between DBMS and RDBMS :-

1)	DBMS applications store data as file.	
              RDBMS applications store data in a tabular form.

2)	In DBMS, data is generally stored in either a hierarchical form or a navigational form.	
              In RDBMS, the tables have an identifier called primary key and the data values are stored in the form of tables.

3)	Normalization is not present in DBMS.	
              Normalization is present in RDBMS.

4)	DBMS does not apply any security with regards to data manipulation.	
               RDBMS defines the integrity constraint for the purpose of ACID (Atomocity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) property.

5)	DBMS uses file system to store data, so there will be no relation between the tables.	
                In RDBMS, data values are stored in the form of tables, so a relationship between these data values will be stored in the form of a table as well.

6)	DBMS has to provide some uniform methods to access the stored information.	
                 RDBMS system supports a tabular structure of the data and a relationship between them to access the stored information.

7)	DBMS does not support distributed database.	
                 RDBMS supports distributed database.

8)	DBMS is meant to be for small organization and deal with small data. it supports single user.	
                  RDBMS is designed to handle large amount of data. it supports multiple users.

9)	Examples of DBMS are file systems, xml etc.	
                  Example of RDBMS are mysql, postgre, sql server, oracle etc.
